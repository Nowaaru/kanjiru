# CONTRIBUTING

You want to become a contributor? Awesome! ✨

When contributing, you must follow a small set of guidelines.

- **Commit Format**

  When writing a commit, it should follow the following format:

  `<type>[field/optional scope]: <description>

  where `field` represents the area where the commit was made:

  - frontend: typescript-centric commit
  - backend: rust-centric commit
  - mixed: commit contains both frontend and backend changes
  - meta: repository-centric commit

  a commit should never contain modifications to more than one
  field. there is only one exception: **if you are reflecting
  an interface change** e.g. ipc

  it is optional to use square brackets, parenthesis, or curly
  brackets for the field.

- **Pull Requests**

  You've finalized your changes and you're ready to make a
  pull request, so what's next?

  First, make sure that you've followed the layout of the
  placeholder. If the bare minimum isn't followed, the
  pull request will be closed.

  Please make sure all checks are passing and ensure that
  code quality is at least something more than a rotten
  spaghetti bowl.

  If your pull request has been in processing for a long time,
  feel free to mention reviewers at any time for a status update.
